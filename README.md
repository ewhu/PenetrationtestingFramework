# Penetration Testing Framework
A robust and modular Go-based framework for efficient vulnerability discovery and penetration testing.

The Penetration Testing Framework is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the penetration testing process, providing a structured approach to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. This framework aims to bridge the gap between manual testing and automated scanning, offering a flexible and customizable solution for security professionals and researchers.

Driven by the need for a more efficient and effective penetration testing process, this framework focuses on modularity, scalability, and ease of use. By providing a robust set of tools and a flexible architecture, the Penetration Testing Framework enables users to tailor their testing approach to specific environments and scenarios, reducing the complexity and time required for comprehensive security assessments.

The Penetration Testing Framework's core features include:

* **Modular Design**: A plug-and-play architecture allowing users to easily integrate new modules and tools into the framework.
* **Multi-Protocol Support**: Native support for various protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, and FTP, enabling comprehensive network and application testing.
* **Customizable Scanning**: Users can create and save custom scan profiles, tailoring the testing process to specific environments and vulnerabilities.
* **Real-time Reporting**: Interactive reporting and visualization tools provide real-time insights into testing results, enabling swift identification and prioritization of critical vulnerabilities.
* **Automation and Orchestration**: Support for automated testing and orchestration, allowing users to schedule and execute complex testing scenarios with ease.
* **Extensive Library**: A comprehensive library of pre-built exploits and vulnerability checks, ensuring users have access to a wide range of testing capabilities.

This framework leverages a range of technologies, including:

* **Go**: The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency, and ease of development.
* **Golang's net** and **crypto** packages: Utilized for network communication and cryptographic operations.
* ** gorilla/websocket**: Enables real-time communication and bi-directional data transfer between the framework and connected clients.
* **sqlite3**: Provides a lightweight and efficient database solution for storing testing results and configuration data.

To install the Penetration Testing Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/PenetrationtestingFramework.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd PenetrationtestingFramework`
3. Install dependencies: `go get -u ./...`
4. Build the framework: `go build main.go`
5. Run the framework: `./PenetrationtestingFramework`

The Penetration Testing Framework relies on the following environment variables:

* `PTF_DB_PATH`: Specifies the path to the SQLite database file.
* `PTF_CFG_PATH`: Defines the location of the framework's configuration file.
* `PTF_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

To use the framework, initiate a new testing session by running `./PenetrationtestingFramework --new-session`. This will prompt the framework to create a new testing environment and provide an interactive shell for configuring and executing tests.
